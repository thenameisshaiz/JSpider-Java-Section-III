Object Class:
-> Object class is the super-most class in Java.
-> In Java, every class directly or indirectly inherited from object class.
-> Object class is present in 'java.lang' package.
-> Object class contains only one constructor which is default-constructor.

---> Methods() of Object Class
     i- hashCode(): It return hash-code value for the given object
        -> hashcode value : It's a unique integer value which is generated by JVM based on the object,
                            which will be used to identify every-object uniquely in the heap-area.
        -> Because of hashcode, searching for the object in the heap-memory by the JVM will be faster.
                            Object obj1 = new Object();
                            obj1.hashCode();
     ii- toString(): It returns the string representation of the given object.
         -> string-representation: The string representation will consist of three parts--
            1- fully qualified class name,
            2- '@' "at the rate" symbol, and
            3- unsigned hexadecimal value of hashCode.
         -> It's recommended that all-classes override the "toString()".
     iii- equals(): equals() compares the hashcode values of given two objects and returns 'true' if
                    they're exactly same else return false.
         -> equals() is very helpful to implement custom-comparisons according to the business logic
                     (requirement).
         -> equals(==) operator: It compares hashcode values of the given two object by-default and this
                                 behaviour can't be overriden(or modified).

Wrapper Class:
-> It's used to convert the primitive values to the java-objects.

Exception Handling:

----> Exception- An unexpected event occurred at the Runtime due to an unexpected operation performed by
                 single-line of code is called as Exception.
                 The code or logic which is written to handle the unexpected event in the program is called
                 exception handling.
                 If the program has an exception but it doesn't have an exception handling logics the the
                 program will stop executing abruptly or the program will crash.
